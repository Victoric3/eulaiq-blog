Students aren’t bored—their textbooks are boring. Maybe you’re boring too. Sorry. But think about it—you find yourself waking that “kid” up every time you start talking. God, it’s worse when it’s a video you made; you have no idea which kid is dozing off.\nEveryone says, “Work smarter, not harder.” But nobody tells you where to actually put all that smart work—or what “smart work” even is. Taking a course to learn how to animate? Hiring one?\nThat’s where EulaIQ comes in—your calm space in a world of editing buzz.\nHow It Works (and Why It Feels So Good) Think of EulaIQ as a digital pen. It\u0026amp;rsquo;s still your ideas, your imagination; we just let the ink flow smoothly. To get your video, just:\nUpload: An audio of that lecture you taught, or read your lecture notes. Prompt: That is where the magic happens, the twist. There\u0026amp;rsquo;s no cursor dragging, just text. Export: It\u0026amp;rsquo;s quick, and that makes starting anything easier. And because everything is connected, when you want to edit even a tiny section, you can use our time machine feature to do it easily. Magic? Almost. Better? Definitely.\nWhat You Can Do With EulaIQ Honestly? Almost anything. But let’s start small.\nAnimate video\nOnboard a team.\nOrganize content in one space\n💬Here’s the thing: EulaIQ doesn’t just make you work better; it makes you enjoy working better.

All through K–12, I was top of my class—not because I was naturally gifted, but because I simply outworked everyone.\nI started preparing for university entrance exams years in advance. I devoured textbooks, practiced past questions, memorized entire chapters. For a long time, it worked.\nBut when I got into pharmacy school, everything changed. Suddenly, the volume of material multiplied. Lecturers moved at a brutal pace, dumping massive resources week after week, expecting us to absorb it all and somehow keep up.\nAt first, I tried to push through the old way—just more hours, more cramming, more exhaustion. But as I studied one document, I could feel a mountain of unread ones piling up in my mind. The bright seasons of my education started to slip into something darker: anxiety, burnout, and the fear that I was forgetting almost everything I read.\nI also had another passion: tech. While pharmacy demanded every ounce of my focus, I was falling in love with full-stack development. I spent long days coding freelance projects, then came home to read more pharmacy material. My eyes were strained, my motivation wore thin, and the gap between effort and retention kept growing.\nI knew there had to be a better way to learn.\nSo I started experimenting. I began converting my dense pharmacy materials into other formats I could consume without staring at a screen—audio recordings I could listen to on the go, questions I could use to test myself, videos to make complex ideas more intuitive.\nAt first, this process was fully manual. I would extract text with OCR, generate questions chunk by chunk, record or synthesize audio, and hunt for videos that matched the topic (shout-out to TED-Ed for saving me more than once). It was tedious, but it worked.\nSuddenly, I wasn’t just surviving pharmacy school—I was learning faster and retaining more.\nWhen I shared these materials with my closest friends, they told me it was a game changer. Some even …","featuredImage":"http://localhost:1313/images/uploads/chatgpt-image-jul-15-2025-02_15_46-pm.png","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/the-day-i-realized-education-was-broken/","summary":"I’ve always been the student who excelled.

Too much.”\nSo I’d procrastinate for weeks.\nThen cram it all in, two days to the exam — mind fried, sleep gone, motivation zero.\nAnd the worst part?\nThat wasn’t a “me” problem.\nThat was a system problem.\nFast forward to now, as a founder — it’s no different.\nI’m surrounded by research papers, essays, technical docs that could literally shift how I build\u0026amp;hellip;\nBut the format makes me avoid them.\nThe value-to-friction ratio is completely broken.\nAnd that’s where the idea for EulaIQ was born.\nWhat EulaIQ Actually Does EulaIQ is the tool I wish I had in school.\nThe assistant I need now.\nThe platform learners everywhere deserve.\nRight now, you can:\n✅ Upload textbooks, slides, PDFs, docs — even handwritten notes\n✅ Get:\n🎧 Personalized voice explainers — your content, in clear, listenable audio\n❓ Auto-generated questions that help you reflect, retain, and track progress\n🔁 Smart learning loops that keep you engaged without cramming\nIt’s like having a personal tutor who doesn’t sleep.\nAnd yes — we give this away for free.\nWhy Free?
