Iâ€™ve always been the student who excelled. All through Kâ€“12, I was top of my classâ€”not because I was naturally gifted, but because I simply outworked everyone. 

I started preparing for university entrance exams years in advance. I devoured textbooks, practiced past questions, memorized entire chapters. For a long time, it worked.

But when I got into pharmacy school, everything changed. Suddenly, the volume of material multiplied. Lecturers moved at a brutal pace, dumping massive resources week after week, expecting us to absorb it all and somehow keep up.

At first, I tried to push through the old wayâ€”just more hours, more cramming, more exhaustion. But as I studied one document, I could feel a mountain of unread ones piling up in my mind. The bright seasons of my education started to slip into something darker: anxiety, burnout, and the fear that I was forgetting almost everything I read.

I also had another passion: tech. While pharmacy demanded every ounce of my focus, I was falling in love with full-stack development. I spent long days coding freelance projects, then came home to read more pharmacy material. My eyes were strained, my motivation wore thin, and the gap between effort and retention kept growing.

I knew there had to be a better way to learn.

So I started experimenting. I began converting my dense pharmacy materials into other formats I could consume without staring at a screenâ€”audio recordings I could listen to on the go, questions I could use to test myself, videos to make complex ideas more intuitive.

At first, this process was fully manual. I would extract text with OCR, generate questions chunk by chunk, record or synthesize audio, and hunt for videos that matched the topic (shout-out to TED-Ed for saving me more than once). It was tedious, but it worked. 

Suddenly, I wasnâ€™t just surviving pharmacy schoolâ€”I was learning faster and retaining more.

When I shared these materials with my closest friends, they told me it was a game changer. Some even found that the AI-generated questions mirrored what showed up in exams. The demand grew, and I began selling the materials. In just a short time, I made about â‚¦18,000. More importantly, I realized: people were willing to pay for something that actually helped them learn.

But it still took hours to prepare each set of materials. I knew if I wanted to make this system work for more people, it had to be automated. So I began building EulaIQ.

At first, I tried to balance everythingâ€”pharmacy, freelance coding, and developing EulaIQ at night. But eventually, the burnout became impossible to ignore. I knew EulaIQ would never reach its potential if it was just my side project. I had to choose.

So I did.

I walked away from pharmacy school to pursue what I knew was my calling: building tools that help people learn better.

Today, EulaIQ is no longer just my personal hack. Itâ€™s a full platform that transforms any topic into videos, quizzes, and podcasts you can actually remember.

Education is broken. Most of us are still stuck in outdated systems that expect you to read, cram, forgetâ€”and repeat. 

It doesnâ€™t have to be this way.
