People ask me why I dropped out of pharmacy school to build an AI study tool.

To some, it sounds reckless.  
Honestly, it kind of was.  
But sometimes you have to bet everything on the problem you can’t ignore.

Growing up, I was always around education.  
My dad runs a K12 school, so most of my life has been filled with ideas around learning, teaching, and improving how we study.

But pharmacy school?

That wasn’t the dream.  
It felt like a *“safe path,”* not a purposeful one.  
I wasn’t passionate about it—I was just going through the motions.

Then came the flood of textbooks. 📚  
Dense, boring, hard to go through.  
I found myself cramming one week before exams, overwhelmed, and mentally drained.

So I tried something different:

🎧 **Turned the material into podcasts**

🧠 **Created questions based on those podcasts**

That one shift changed everything.

I could listen anywhere—on the go, while walking, while eating—and retain far more.  
Then I’d solve questions to lock it in.  
It felt like I was finally learning, not memorizing.

I shared these with my classmates.  
They loved it.  
But creating them was a grind—hours of audio editing and question writing.  
Not scalable.

So I built a tool to automate it.  
That tool became **EulaIQ**.

I’m a full stack developer, and for the first time, I had something worth building.  
I tried to balance both pharmacy and EulaIQ—but it wasn’t sustainable.

If EulaIQ was going to be real, it needed my full attention.

So I made the choice:

❌ Pharmacy

✅ Solving a real problem

Today, **EulaIQ is live.**  
It turns any dense textbook into:

- Bite-sized podcasts
- Smart quizzes
- *(Soon)* Animated explainers

No more passive reading.  
Just learning that sticks.

Looking back, it wasn’t about dropping out.  
It was about choosing to build something that actually matters to me—and to others.
